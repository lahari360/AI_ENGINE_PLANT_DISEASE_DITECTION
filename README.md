## Problem Statement 
The agricultural sector faces challenges in identifying and managing plant diseases effectively. The severity of these diseases can lead to significant crop losses and impact food security.

## About the Project
Our project aims to address these challenges by using AI technology to detect plant diseases early. This proactive approach enables farmers to take timely actions and minimize crop losses.

## Technical Implementation 
We implemented a machine learning model that analyzes images of plants to identify disease symptoms. The model utilizes multiple flowcharts and algorithms to accurately diagnose plant diseases.

- Utilized deep learning techniques for image recognition
- Implemented a user-friendly interface for easy access and usability
